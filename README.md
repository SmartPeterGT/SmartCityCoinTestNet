# SmartCityCoinTestNet
Smart City Project
The Smart City Coin Test Net is a utility token aimed to be used within the European Smart City Community. 
Our main goal is to provide Smart House Hardware and Services for the Members of our Community, enabling them to start monitoring their usage in real-time. We also present the business opportunity to all community members they will be able to collect SCCTN tokens in exchange for their energy data.  We are incorporating the blockchain technology and SCCTN Utility Token to provide transparency, traceability, and safety of the entire network and community.

The SC project is upgrading the smart house software and hardware with advanced blockchain technology. The main reason for it is to establish a Utility Token, a digital cryptocurrency that utilizes data on energy contributions. Our technology offers a transparent, secure storage of information about Community Members contributions.

We decided not only to create a digital coupon or voucher but to provide members with the advantage of the blockchain technology and create a smart cryptocurrency.

The main functionality of the SCCTN Token is to be used as a payment in our webshop and among Community Members, later we plan to offer additional functionality that will server when interacting with utilities.

SCCTN Token will be infrastructure for Building Community of Smart houses by Sharing Experience about energy use
